# Conda Environment Activation Rule

Always activate the conda environment 'rag-student-support' before running any python commands.

When executing Python scripts or commands in the terminal:
1. First run: `conda activate rag-student-support`
2. Then execute the Python command

This ensures all dependencies are available and the correct Python interpreter is used.
